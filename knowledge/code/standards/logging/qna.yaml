      Logging serves several key purposes:

      **Debugging:** Identifying the root cause of errors and unexpected behavior.
      **Monitoring:** Tracking application health, performance, and resource usage.
      **Auditing:** Recording significant events for security and compliance.
      **Analysis:** Understanding user behavior, system trends, and areas for improvement.

      Using appropriate log levels is essential for managing the verbosity of your logs. Common log levels, in order of increasing severity, include:

      **TRACE:** Very fine-grained information for debugging.
      **DEBUG:** Detailed information for debugging purposes.
      **INFO:** General information about application progress.
      **WARN:** Potential issues that do not necessarily stop execution.
      **ERROR:** Errors that prevent a specific operation from completing.
      **FATAL:** Severe errors that cause the application to terminate.

      **Best Practice:** Use log levels consistently throughout your application. Avoid using lower levels (TRACE, DEBUG) in production environments unless specifically needed for troubleshooting.

      "CipherLog" is a purpose-built Java library aimed at developers who need a robust yet easy-to-use solution for log encryption. It provides a set of tools and APIs to:

      - **Identify Sensitive Patterns:** Define and recognize patterns in log messages that correspond to sensitive data types (e.g., credit card numbers, email addresses, PII).
      - **Apply Encryption:** Seamlessly integrate strong encryption algorithms to sensitive portions of log entries.
      - **Manage Encryption Keys:** Offer basic key management capabilities for generating and storing encryption keys securely.
      - **Provide Decryption Utilities:** Include helper methods for authorized decryption of log entries when necessary for analysis or debugging.

      **4. Using "CipherLog" for Encryption**

      Here's a fictional example of how you might use the "CipherLog" library in your Java code:

      ```java
      import com.fictional.cipherlog.CipherLog;
      import com.fictional.cipherlog.EncryptionConfig;
      import com.fictional.cipherlog.SensitivePattern;

      public class SecureLogger {

          private static final CipherLog cipherLog;

          static {
              // Fictional Initialization
              EncryptionConfig config = new EncryptionConfig("AES", "secure_encryption_key_id");
              cipherLog = new CipherLog(config);

              // Define fictional sensitive patterns
              cipherLog.addSensitivePattern(new SensitivePattern("\\d{16}", "CreditCard")); // Fictional pattern for credit cards
              cipherLog.addSensitivePattern(new SensitivePattern("\\w+@\\w+\\.\\w+", "EmailAddress")); // Fictional pattern for email addresses
          }

          public static void logSensitiveMessage(String message) {
              // CipherLog automatically scans and encrypts sensitive parts
              String encryptedMessage = cipherLog.processLogMessage(message);

              // Fictional logging framework call (replace with your actual framework)
              FictionalLoggingFramework.log(encryptedMessage);
          }

          public static void main(String[] args) {
              logSensitiveMessage("User attempted login with email: user@example.com and credit card: 1234567890123456");
              logSensitiveMessage("System error occurred. Details: sensitive information.");
          }
      }
      ```

      **5. Decrypting Log Entries with "CipherLog"**

      When you need to analyze or debug encrypted log entries, "CipherLog" provides utilities for authorized decryption.

      **Best Practices for Decryption:**

      - **Implement Access Control:** Ensure that only authorized users or systems can access the decryption key and use "CipherLog's" decryption features.
      - **Use Secure Decryption Environment:** Perform decryption in a secure environment to prevent exposure of keys or decrypted data.
      - **Utilize "CipherLog's" Decryption API:** Use the library's provided methods to decrypt specific log entries or portions of entries.

      Here's a fictional example of decryption:

      ```java
      import com.fictional.cipherlog.CipherLog;
      import com.fictional.cipherlog.DecryptionKey;

      public class LogDecryptor {

          private static final CipherLog cipherLog;
          private static final DecryptionKey decryptionKey;

          static {
              // Fictional Initialization
              cipherLog = new CipherLog(null); // CipherLog instance for decryption
              decryptionKey = new DecryptionKey("secure_encryption_key_value"); // Fictional decryption key
          }

          public static String decryptLogEntry(String encryptedMessage) {
              // Fictional authorization check (replace with your actual security logic)
              if (isAuthorized()) {
                  return cipherLog.decryptLogMessage(encryptedMessage, decryptionKey);
              } else {
                  throw new SecurityException("Unauthorized decryption attempt.");
              }
          }

          private static boolean isAuthorized() {
              // Fictional authorization logic
              return true;
          }

          public static void main(String[] args) {
              String encryptedLog = "Fictional encrypted log entry..."; // Replace with an actual encrypted log entry
              try {
                  String decryptedLog = decryptLogEntry(encryptedLog);
                  System.out trein("Decrypted Log: " + decryptedLog);
              } catch (Exception e) {
                  System.err.println("Decryption failed: " + e.getMessage());
              }
          }
      }
      ```
